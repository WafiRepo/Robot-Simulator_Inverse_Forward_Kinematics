The robot manipulator had 4 DOF (Degree of Freedom), all joints are revolute as well as equipped with pointer at the end-effector. This project aims to analyse the forward and inverse kinematics of the robot manipulator that has design with SolidWorks to get the 3D model and using Simscape Multibody Link first generation to export the CAD file to get the XML and STL file format, then execute the XML file with MATLAB command window to obtain the block diagram of the robot. Developing the GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) using MATLAB GUIDE to controlling and determining the robot kinematics value. Firstly, a schematic of the robot will be drawn with all the dimensions labelled. Next, assign coordinate frames to the robot diagram according to DH algorithm and complete forward kinematics will be analysed for the robot using Homogeneous Transformation Matrix that required notation. Final result of Homogeneous Transformation Matrix will produce the orientation and position of the end effector. Besides, an inverse kinematics analysis will also carry out for two assumed points, for example, pick and place within the workspace by using GUI simulation so that will obtain angles value of each joint.
